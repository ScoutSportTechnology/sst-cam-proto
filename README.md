# SST-Cam Protocol

> **This repo is the single source of truth for the SST-Cam wire contract.**
> It is consumed as a git submodule (mounted at `proto/`) by both
> `sst-cam-app` and `sst-cam-firmware`.
>
> **Firmware developers:** the complete implementation contract — session lifecycle,
> required commands, overlay *authoring*, file layout, and constraints — lives in
> **`docs/firmware-spec.md`** in the **`sst-cam-app`** repo. This README is a
> developer quick-reference for the proto wire format only.
>
> **Overlay rendering semantics** — the rules both stacks must render identically
> (coordinate space, fonts/text layout, shapes, color/opacity, tolerance) — live
> in **`overlay-rendering.md`** in *this* repo, since both consumers must match
> them. (Split: rendering rules here; overlay authoring/UX in the app's
> `firmware-spec.md`.)

All control messages are encoded as Protocol Buffers (proto3). The app writes
requests and reads responses over a two-characteristic GATT service for
control, and pulls bulk data (live preview, recording downloads) over a WiFi
Direct link.

## Channel split

| Channel       | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| BLE GATT      | Commands, telemetry, match state, thumbnails                 |
| WiFi Direct   | Live preview (RTSP H.264 over WiFi Direct), recording downloads (HTTP) |

BLE is always available. The WiFi Direct group is brought up automatically
once BLE pairs (the app sends `StartWifiDirectCommand` and receives
credentials in `WifiDirectGroupResponse`). The phone joins the group on the
WiFi side, then opens an RTSP connection to `rtsp://<group_owner_ip>:8554/preview`.
See `wifi.proto`.

## Device discovery and filtering

The firmware MUST advertise the SST-Cam service UUID in its BLE advertising
payload. The app filters scan results by this UUID — devices that do not
advertise it are ignored regardless of name.

As a secondary check, the app also requires the device name to match the prefix
`sst-cam-` (e.g. `sst-cam-0001`, `sst-cam-0042`). The firmware MUST set the
BLE device name to follow this format: `sst-cam-NNNN` where NNNN is a
zero-padded 4-digit unit number.

This two-layer filter (UUID + name prefix) ensures the app never shows
unrelated BLE devices to the user.

## GATT Service Layout

| Role | UUID | Properties |
| ---- | ---- | ---------- |
| **SST-Cam Service** | `A1B2C3D4-0001-0000-8000-00805F9B34FB` | — |
| Command Write | `A1B2C3D4-0011-0000-8000-00805F9B34FB` | Write Without Response |
| Command Response | `A1B2C3D4-0012-0000-8000-00805F9B34FB` | Notify |

> **UUID note:** These UUIDs are placeholders. Replace with officially registered
> UUIDs before production. The layout must not change without updating both this
> document and the firmware.

Only two characteristics are needed. All data flows through them — there are no
dedicated push/notification characteristics for telemetry or match state.

## Communication model — app pulls, firmware responds

**The app is always the initiator.** The firmware never pushes unsolicited data.

- The app sends a `Command` to the **Command Write** characteristic.
- The firmware processes it and sends a `CommandResponse` via **Command Response** notify.
- The app matches request to response via `correlation_id`.

Polling responsibilities (all on the app side):

| Data | Command | Suggested interval |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Telemetry | `GetTelemetryCommand` | 1 s |
| Match state | `GetMatchStateCommand` | deferred in v1 (telemetry covers operational needs) |
| Thumbnail | `ThumbnailRequest` | on demand |

The firmware MUST respond to every command. If it cannot, it MUST send a
`CommandResponse` with `status = ERROR` and a descriptive `error_message`.

## MTU and Chunking

Request MTU 512 bytes after connect (the maximum). Actual MTU depends on
negotiation; minimum guaranteed is 23 bytes (20 usable after ATT overhead).

**All messages use the `ChunkedPayload` envelope** to handle payloads larger
than the negotiated MTU. The `correlation_id` links chunks to their request.

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ChunkedPayload                               │
│   correlation_id  : string                   │
│   chunk_index     : uint32  (0-based)        │
│   total_chunks    : uint32                   │
│   data            : bytes   (proto payload)  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Single-chunk messages set `chunk_index = 0` and `total_chunks = 1`.

**Thumbnail note:** Target ≤ 160×90 JPEG at quality 60 (~4–8 KB).
At 500-byte chunks ≈ 10–20 writes.

**Flow control (symmetric):** The receiver — *either* side — acknowledges each
received chunk with a `ChunkAck` write keyed by `correlation_id` + `chunk_index`,
and the sender MUST withhold the next chunk until that ack arrives. This applies
in **both** directions: app→camera command chunks and camera→app response chunks.
`ChunkAck` has no direction field by design — it is symmetric.

## Schema files

The BLE control schema previously lived in six files (`command`, `telemetry`,
`match`, `recording`, `team`, `config`). They were consolidated into a single
`bluetooth.proto` to mirror the unified `wifi.proto` style. During the merge,
the `Sport` enum was deduplicated (the previous match.proto / team.proto
copies disagreed on integer values — the wider match.proto set won) and
`PlayerInfo.position` was retyped from `string` to the `PlayerPosition` enum.

| File | Contents |
| ---- | -------- |
| `bluetooth.proto` | All BLE control schema: framing, `Command` / `CommandResponse` envelopes, telemetry, match events, recording / streaming, session push, WiFi Direct handshake |
| `wifi.proto` | WiFi-only descriptors: RTSP preview stream descriptor, preview heartbeat |
| `overlay-rendering.md` | Normative overlay rendering semantics both stacks must match: coordinate space, text layout, shapes, color/opacity, tolerance + reference fixtures (companion to `bluetooth.proto` §11) |

**Regenerating Dart bindings:** run `just gen-proto` inside the devcontainer.
Requires `protoc` and `protoc_plugin 21.1.2` (pinned to match `protobuf: 3.1.0`).
Install: `sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler && dart pub global activate protoc_plugin 21.1.2`

## Versioning

- Use `reserved` to tombstone removed field numbers so they are never reused.
- `DeviceInfoResponse.protocol_version` (uint32) is incremented on breaking
  schema changes. The app warns and disables unsupported features when the
  firmware protocol version is behind what the app expects.
- Adding optional fields is backward-compatible.
- Removing, renaming, or renumbering fields requires a coordinated firmware +
  app release.
